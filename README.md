# My first easy CNN Project
Following the guidance of the hw2p2 Starter notebook (also with many codes provided by it) and using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/11-785-s23-hw2p2-classification/overview, I first built a net which has the same structure as ConvneXt_small to get the model for classificaition task. Then, I retrained the saved model with Arcface loss to get a net for the verification task. The classification model seems to perform well and reach an accuracy of about 87.9% tested by the validation data, but the net for verification failed to improve and I'll try to find a better way to train it. Detailed training data could be seen in https://wandb.ai/594553306/hw2p2?workspace=user-594553306.
